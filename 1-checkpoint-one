Hi, my name is Chris Bart. I'm based in Minneapolis, MN. I like pizza and tacos. 


<h1>**Surveys and Testing**</h1>
1. @Saphyer aka Felicia Jackson - user survey for cloud storage
2. @Ef aka Efren Castillo - user survey for user profiles
3. @Christian aka Christian Domingo - user survey for public transit 


<h1>**My Bloc Goals:**</h1>
* Continually learn and challenge myself every day during my Bloc experience.
* Become an active Bloc community member and network as much as possible. 
* Persevere through difficult challenges with patience, gratitude and an open mind.
* Successfully complete 12 checkpoints each week in order to complete the program in 4 months. 


I will naturally be good at:
* visual design aesthetics.
* problem solving. 
* staying motivated in order to reach my goal. 
* providing high quality finished projects that I am proud of. 

I will need to improve:
* asking for help when needed in a clear, concise, level-headed manner.
* keep the positive momentum moving forward, doing what I can even when I get side tracked or off course during a problematic situation.
* to improve and work on my front end development skills.
* to not get too upset when I suck at something but instead I just need to practice more. 


Exercises

Introduce yourself to the Bloc team by completing the following tasks:

- [x] Upload a photo of yourself to your Bloc account.

- [x] Complete your account and bio in Bloc.

- [x] Briefly review Markdown syntax. You don't have to memorize all the syntax now, and you can certainly ask for assistance in Student Slack about common Markdown idioms. Try to get a feel for some of the basic syntax, like headings, links and code blocks.

- [x] Read this blog post written by Bloc's CEO, Clint. It shares essential tips with what he has learned about successful traits for new students. Make a submission using Markdown, and share which attributes in this checkpoint or in the blog post that you will naturally be good at and which traits you will need to improve.

- [x] Introduce yourself to other students in the Design Program using the #design-program channel in Bloc's Student Slack. Ask other students which group sessions they have found useful.

- [x] Sign up for an upcoming group session.

- [x] Participate in at least three research projects in #surveys-and-testing. In your submission, list which students you assisted and the type of research you participated in (user survey, user testing, card sorting, etc.).

- [x] Write a list of goals in a message that you hope to achieve during Bloc. Use this list of goals to prepare for your first mentor session.
